# PowerBI Dashboards 
### Hospitality Analytics Dashboard  

This project involved developing an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing key metrics in the hospitality industry, such as occupancy rate, average daily rate (ADR), and revenue trends. The project was designed to simulate real-world scenarios in hotel management, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making.  

#### Key Features:  
- Comprehensive Data Preparation: Utilized Power Query for cleaning, transforming, and modeling raw data, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.  
- Interactive Dashboard: Designed a visually intuitive dashboard to display critical KPIs, trends, and performance comparisons (e.g., weekday vs. weekend performance).  
- Revenue Analysis: Created dynamic measures and calculated columns using DAX to evaluate booking patterns, revenue performance, and customer behavior.  
- Stakeholder-Centric Approach: Incorporated stakeholder feedback to refine visualizations and ensure alignment with business objectives.  
- Scenario-Based Insights: Addressed operational challenges such as room occupancy fluctuations, pricing strategies, and revenue optimization using dynamic and conditional visualizations.  

#### Learning Outcomes:  
- Developed hands-on expertise in Power BI, Power Query, and DAX for data analytics and visualization.  
- Gained experience in implementing data-driven solutions for the hospitality domain, leveraging industry-relevant metrics.  
- Strengthened skills in presenting actionable insights through interactive dashboards, facilitating data-driven decision-making.  

This project demonstrates the integration of analytics and business understanding to solve real-world challenges effectively.
